[![go-rbtree build status](https://travis-ci.org/tmaesaka/go-rbtree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tmaesaka/go-rbtree)

Currently under construction. Head over to [commits](https://github.com/tmaesaka/go-rbtree/commits/master) for updates and [tree.go](https://github.com/tmaesaka/go-rbtree/blob/master/tree.go) to get a sense of the API.
